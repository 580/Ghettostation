- add credits
- configure Baudrate from menu
- (done) add servos test 
- add Multiwii protocol queries ( Active mode )
- smooth/ease servos
- handle compass on the tracker to remove calibration.
- handle a GPS on the tracker to manage a mobile tracker.
- add Eosbandi GPS filtering to smooth out gps positions.
- remove all Strings stuff & replace them with char[] ( will free some memory )
- add a deadband margin before inverting pan/tilt servo on 180/180 config.
- stop tracking when UAV/home distance is <10m
- for Mega boards only: Define all telemetry protocols at compile time 
  and autodetect it when running ( not enough memory on atmega 328 )
- depending of memory, add some other telemetric values while flying ( flight time, voltage, flight mode, etc )
- add a voltage divider on the arduino and display current ground battery voltage, with alert when getting low.
